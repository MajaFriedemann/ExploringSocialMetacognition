# Nick's feedback
* Centre advisor portrait 
* ~~Remove blue advisor background~~
* ~~Fix advisor indicator on Mac (height of invisible element?)~~
* ~~Make advisor change the only salient between trial change (remove fading stuff on the response markers)~~
* ~~Make advisors less sure (increase distance needed to achieve 100% confident)~~

* ~~Ensure advisors in test blocks match advisors in training blocks~~

* ~~Check stats on the feedback overview~~
* ~~Easy way to exit the feedback page (and remove the fullscreen warning!)~~

* ~~100% 100% main content display regardless of fullscreen - grid layout at least~~
