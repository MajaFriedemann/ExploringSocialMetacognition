# To do list:

## Benevolence study
### Initial
* Finalize design
* Preregistration
* Run
* Data analysis
### Registered Report
* Identify journal(s)
* RR phase 1
* Revise RR
* Run RR
* RR phase 2

## Core studies
* Clarify marker usage (confidence)
* Implement Agree-in-confidence/uncertainty advisors
* Run AiC/AiU study
### Advisor choice
* Implement advisor choice
* Run advisor choice for Agree/Accurate
    * Choice trials should give offbrand advice, so influence can be compared on choice trials

## Non-advice-takers

* Develop paradigm for testing people's base levels of advice-seeking/taking
    * Time-taking alternative to getting advice
        * See advice but opt out of using it before/after seeing it?

## Agent-based models
* Build model of agents' advisor-updating and source selection
* Run dynamic networks of interacting agents
* Characterize resulting network structures based on agent properties (e.g. model components)
* Does including non-advice-takers change network structure?
    * Model as normal agents with particularly low update rates?

## Real-life networks
* Characterize real-life social networks in terms used for ABMs above
* Compare RL networks to ABM networks

## Write thesis
